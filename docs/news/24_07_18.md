It's not easy to work on a personal side project, when you have family, house to maintain and you work all day on a project!  
R.I.P my evenings!

However, I finally got around to do some long overdue updates in Apex Libra :)



# Query 2.0.0
[Link to Query framework](/apex/query)

## Mocking Overhaul
New major release of the Query framework is mainly focused on new way of mocking queries.  
From now on, you don't need to specify mock id, but can mock using method name from which the query was executed.

```apex
public with sharing class AccountQuotingService {

    public void generateQuotes(Set<Id> accountIds) {
        List<Accounts> accounts = Query.Accounts.byId(accountIds).getList();
        // ... Business Logic
    }
}
```

```apex
@IsTest
static void myTestMethod() {
    Query.mock(Account.SObjectType, 'AccountQuotingService.generateQuotes', new List<Account>{
        // my mocked query result
    });
    //or
    Query.Accounts.mock('AccountQuotingService.generateQuotes', new List<Account>{
        new Account(Name = 'MyMockedAccount')
    });
}
```

## Wrapped Queries
Sometimes, you don't want to introduce a new query class or use a generic query, but you'd still want to benefit from the Query capabilities.
This is possible using query wrapper.

Consider this example:
```apex
public with sharing class QuotingService {

    public void generateQuotes(Set<Id> accountIds) {
        List<Account> accounts = Query.of([
            SELECT Id, Name, CreatedBy.Name
            FROM Account
            WHERE Id IN :accountIds
        ]).getList();

        // Rest of the business logic
    }
} 
```

Query wraps query results into Query.Results class. Now, we can use that to mock the query outcome in tests:
```apex
@IsTest
static void testGenerateQuotes() {
    Query.mock(Account.SObject, 'QuotingService.generateQuotes', new List<Account>{
        new Account(Name = 'My Mock Account')
    });
}
```
While a query is still issued against a database, the class received only a mocked result. This does not impact test performance much,
since a majority of the test slowdowns come from data creation and this query will be empty in tests.

Another benefit is that our pure apex tests will track query limit usage realistically.

With wrapped queries, you can also benefit from reducer methods:

## Other
- Added .orderBy() method
- Renamed `withFieldAccess` to `stripInaccessible` to avoid confusion of AccessType with AccessLevel
- Added method `with(AccessLevel.SYSTEM_MODE)` to enforce all fields and sobjects permissions
- Added `getCursor()` method
- Removed Query - QueryObject syntactic sugar inheritance

# Collection 2.0.0 
[Link to Collection](/apex/collection)

Collection changed the syntax for reducers to:
```apex
Collection.of(accounts).collect(Account.AnnualRevenue)
| .getSet();
| .getList();
| .getSum();
| .getMax();
| .getMin();
```

- Changed custom Comparator interface to a standard that was introduced in Winter '24
- getList/getSet reducers are more robust, but now require collect calls
- Arithmetic reducers are more robust and work on collections of numeric values
```apex
Collection.of(accounts).collect(Account.AnnualRevenue).getList();
Collection.of(accounts).collect(Account.AnnualRevenue).getSet();
Collection.of(accounts).collect(Account.AnnualRevenue).getSum();
```
- Fixed wrong type returned in getList method
- API Version bumped to 61.0

# Fixes & Improvements

### HTTP Callout Mock Router 1.0.2
[Link](/apex/http-mock-router)
- Fixed bug in HTTP Headers specified in metadata, where header value would not be parsed correctly if it contained colon, which would cause issues for Location
  headers.
